pig:
- potentially want to *not* de-dupe CDX lines by uniq sha1 in all cases; run
  this as a second-stage filter? for example, may want many URL links in fatcat
  for a single file (different links, different policies)

- include input file name (and chunk? and CDX?) in sentry context
- play with test image on older releases (eg, trusty)

- how to get argument (like --hbase-table) into mrjob.conf, or similar?
- fix pig gitlab-ci tests (JAVA_HOME). also make fetch_deps *way* more quiet
- sentry: https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python

- https://github.com/blaze/blaze (for catalog/analytics)
- validation: https://github.com/pyeve/cerberus
- testing (to replace nose):
    - https://github.com/CleanCut/green
    - pytest
    - mamba ("behavior driven")
