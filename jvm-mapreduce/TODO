Libraries:
- sbt? or gradle? (build tool)
    => debian packages: https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
       (or just a single .deb...)
- scalding (mapreduce framework)
- scala (java also fine?)
    => will scala work with java 1.7?
    => scala 2.11 (~2014) works with java 7; scala 2.12 and up require 8
    => debian stretch: scala 2.11.8-1
    => ubuntu xenial: scala/xenial 2.11.6-6
    => "Scalding works with Scala 2.10 and 2.11 is recommended"
- testing
- hbase connector library
    => maybe spyglass?
- hbase mock
