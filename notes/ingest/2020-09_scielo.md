As a follow-up to `SCIELO-CRAWL-2020-07`, going to bulk ingest all existing
fatcat releases with no IA copy and with `publisher_type:scielo`. There are
200k+ such releases.

It seems like some of these are HTML or XML, eg: https://doi.org/10.4321/s1132-12962011000300008

Could try XML ingest of these!
