Background context needed:
- CDX text file format
- rough arch outline (what runs where)
- basic hadoop+hbase overview
- hbase schema
- quick look at hadoop and hbase web interfaces
- maybe quick re-profile?

Plan/Steps:
x together: get *any* JVM map/reduce thing to build and run on cluster
x together: get something to build that talks to hbase
x basic JVM test infra; HBase mockup. "shopping"
    => scalding and/or cascading
x simple hbase scan report generation (counts/stats)
x CDX parsing
- complete backfill script

Spec for CDX backfill script:
- input is CDX, output to HBase table
- filter input before anything ("defensive"; only PDF, HTTP 200, size limit)
- reads HBase before insert; don't overwrite
